# Snake-Game
This was the first game I programmed.

This little game is a training as a result of passing the courses "programming 1" and "programming 2", at Biccoca University (Milan, Italy). 
I passed both courses with ratings of 26/30 (prog. 1) and 30/30 (prog. 2).

The code is unnecessarily over-engineered (the code would have been a lot simple without classes, hierachy etc...).
The main goal was to brush up on the OOP paradigm from the perspective of Java, not to write "the best code for Snake".
